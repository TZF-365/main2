In creating a business, your main goal is to make money. But the trust is, having a general customer avatar, will not give you much outcome. No matter how says it.

Heck, not even persons in marketing communicate generally. 

This list of 3 unique tips for finding a niche. This is just my opinion and would love to be proven otherwise.

Tip 1;

Your business plan: Yes, yes, yes. I can say a lot here, but I want this to be quick. So in my opinion, you have to improve your business plan before starting anything. This is why.

In business, you want to specifically target an audience that is in immediate need of what you offer, but where should I go to find them. Now that is for tip 2.

Tip 2;

Communities: Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, etc. So many platforms but rare client retention potential. But in my opinion, being in specific groups can bring some benefit. But the thing is, you need to a part of it.

Even small sites like Influence.co hold thousands of small influencers, targeted for different industries. That in of itself gives light to brand new opportunities for gain clientele. 

Tip 3;

The message: In building a business, it’s easy to create one but it’s another thing to sustain one. With that are a CEO, your message can be generic. You have a unique voice, a unique perspective.

That’s the word you need to have in doing anything. Uniqueness sales, some say generic to, but it’s a short period of time. 

For example. In talking to a personal friend of mines. They wanted to start a business. I ask, what your message. He was confused. I said, what is make you unique. For 2 days he pondered on that statement, came back with a business plan with was amazing. I was afraid of him being in the Apparel industry. But he comes through to specifically target his message to young adults.
