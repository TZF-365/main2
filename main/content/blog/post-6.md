Now, this is not YouTube. If the insane copyright laws were enough, this might take YouTube to a dark place. 

So earlier this afternoon I received an email like everyone else, about 3 updates that will be introduced to the platform,

    1. Facial recognition restrictions: The Terms of Service already state that you cannot collect any information that might identify a person without their permission. While this has always included facial recognition information, the new Terms make that explicitly clear. (Understandable)
    2. Royalty payments and tax withholding: For creators entitled to revenue payments, such payments will be treated as royalties from a U.S. tax perspective and Google will withhold taxes where required by law. (Ok, understandable)
    3. YouTube’s right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program. (Now wait)

This is not it. Now the multi-billion dollar application, YouTube, can, in the next 10 days, have the full right to monetize themselves. Again YouTube is worth around $300 billion. So. If. A channel hasn’t been verified through your program, but then a creator has to slave and pays money at times before even uploading a video, to understand all of the big daddy Google’s tools. 

Being Free, Is a Price. No more of a regular person who loves uploading on YouTube and then found a gold mine of newfound capital to feed themselves, almost post the most deadly virus in human history. No more. Because you wasting our services, so have to pay.

YouTube has now made it impossible to make their channel and be monetized with being verified but at the same time, people are getting copyright strikes for 2-3 secs of a song, and claim their entire video.

Wow. Just wow YouTube. You have officially monopolized yourselves.
